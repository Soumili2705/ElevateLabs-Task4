# Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship — Task 4  
## Feature Encoding & Scaling

This repository contains my submission for **Task 4** of the Elevate Labs AI & ML Internship, which focuses on preparing raw data for machine learning by applying **feature encoding and feature scaling techniques**.



##  Dataset Used

**Adult Income Dataset**

This dataset contains demographic and employment-related information and is commonly used for classification tasks.



##  Objective

The objective of this task is to preprocess the dataset and make it **machine-learning ready** by:
- Converting categorical features into numerical form
- Scaling numerical features to a standard range
- Producing a clean, processed dataset that can be directly used for model training



## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab  



##  Steps Performed

- Identified **numerical** and **categorical** features in the dataset  
- Applied **Label Encoding** to ordered categorical features  
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to nominal categorical features  
- Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**  
- Saved the final processed dataset for further machine learning tasks  



## Files in This Repository

- `Task4_Feature_Encoding_Scaling.ipynb` — Notebook containing all preprocessing steps  
- `adult_processed.csv` — Final processed dataset after encoding and scaling  


##  Conclusion

This task demonstrates the importance of **feature engineering and preprocessing** in machine learning pipelines. Encoding and scaling are essential steps to ensure that models can correctly interpret and learn from the data.

The final dataset is now fully prepared for training machine learning models.
